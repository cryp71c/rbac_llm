# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

This project explores the implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Large Language Models (LLMs). The objective is to train an LLM on an organization's data while ensuring that users only access information they are permitted to see. By using an "Impersonation" token, the LLM can summarize data according to the user's permissions, guaranteeing data confidentiality and integrity.

## Learning Gameplan

### 1. **Understand Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   - **Objective:** Gain a foundational understanding of RBAC principles.
   - **Key Topics:**
     - Basic concepts of RBAC (Roles, Permissions, Users, and Role Assignments) for Windows and *NIX devices.
     - How RBAC is implemented in software systems.
   - **Resources:**
     - [NIST RBAC Model](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-162/final)
     - [Introduction to Role-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

### 2. **Learn About Large Language Models (LLMs)**

   - **Objective:** Familiarize yourself with LLMs, their architecture, and training processes.
   - **Key Topics:**
     - Overview of GPT-2 and other transformer-based models.
     - How LLMs are trained and fine-tuned.

### 4. **Experiment and Validate**

   - **Objective:** Test the implementation and validate the effectiveness of RBAC in your LLM.
   - **Key Topics:**
     - Evaluating the model's adherence to RBAC policies.
     - Measuring the performance and accuracy of the LLM in summarizing data.
